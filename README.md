Modeling LSST visibility of TDEs using stellar and SMBH IMFs

The goal of this project is to provide a realistic estimate of the visibility of Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) as viewed from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin observatory. Populations of both stars and the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) will be generated from IMFs (source both here). The light curves of the events will be generated and run through the LSST simulation pipeline to determine their visibility.
